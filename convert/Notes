The convert folder is for making the linvstconvert and linvstconverttree (navigates subfolders) utilities that name convert Windows vst dll filenames (.dll) to corresponding Linux shared library filenames (.so).

The makegtk etc files in the convert folder contain simple commands for making the convert utilities.

Depending on which option is chosen (gtk2 gtk3 subdirectories(tree)) makegtk2 makegtk2tree makegtk3 and makegtk3tree need to be made executable ie chmod +x makegtk3

Then run it by changing into the directory and running ./makegtk3 etc

A -no-pie option might be needed on some systems for the linvstconvert and linvstconverttree icons to appear.

Use makegtk3-withicon etc for the -no-pie icon option.
